## **In this file I will talk about the three User Stories as requested in the Task of day 4.**

### *User Stories*:

* ### As an EnaLabs student user, I would like to have an easier-to-read tab on GitHub, to improve my reading.
* ### As a user, I would like to have a tab to answer our questions quickly, so it would help me in moments of doubt when I want to know something fast (Example: a bot).
* ### I would also like more examples given in the Tasks to know if we are doing exactly what the Task wants, this would help guide us better.
