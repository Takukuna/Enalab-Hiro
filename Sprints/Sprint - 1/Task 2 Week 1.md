# The app I chose is Facebook, which I will mention 3 Functional Requirements and 2 Non-Functional Requirements.

## **Functional:**

* ### 1- We can mention the most obvious one, such as login, necessary for the user to have an account on the app and keep their information saved in case they want to uninstall it
* ### 2- We can also mention the friends system on the platform, where we can send messages, for example.
* ### 3- We also have the birthday system, where it notifies (on the day) the birthday of a friend that has been added.

## **Non-functional:**

* ### 1- We have the simplest ones, such as the app opening in X seconds (Example: 3 seconds).
* ### 2- Another one that can be mentioned is code optimization, to avoid lags and freezes due to the feed of videos and photos.
